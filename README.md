# awesome-life-extension

In this repository, I will collect useful scientific research and resources for life extension.

I believe that humanity is currently standing on the edge of breaking through the limits of life. Our generation should start preparing and accumulating resources for the future. Especially as ordinary people with fewer resources, we should accumulate reliable and useful resources so that when the technology arrives, we can catch the wave to obtain longer life or higher quality of life.

我认为人类目前已经站在了突破生命极限的边缘。我们这一代人应该开始做准备，为未来积累资源，尤其是作为普通人，我们的资源更少，所以更应该积累可靠且有用的资源，当技术来临时，我们能够抓住机会获得更长的生命或者更高的生活质量。

I also believe that we or our next generation can achieve longer life through step-by-step progress, rather than waiting for a sudden breakthrough in some future technology. Therefore, I prefer to call this process "Scientific Cultivation". Cultivation is not something that can be achieved overnight, but requires step-by-step accumulation.

我还认为，我们或者我们的下一代可以通过分步骤来获得更长的生命，而不是等待未来某一项技术的突然突破。所以我更愿意称这个过程为"科学修真"。修真不是一蹴而就的，而是需要一步一步的积累。

## Cardiovascular Health
Make sure your cardiovascular health is good. Because bad cardiovascular health is the number one killer of longevity.
